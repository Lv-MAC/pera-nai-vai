## 🔄 How to Update Your App

### When You Add a New Tool or Feature:

1. **Make your changes** (add new HTML, CSS, JS files)

2. **Update service worker version** in `sw.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Change this line:
   const CACHE_VERSION = 'pera-nai-vai-v1.0.0';

   // To:
   const CACHE_VERSION = 'pera-nai-vai-v1.1.0'; // Increment version
   ```

3. **If new files need caching**, add to `sw.js`:
   ```javascript
   const TOOL_PAGES = [
     // ... existing pages
     '/your-new-tool.html'  // Add your new page
   ];
   ```

4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new tool + update PWA version"
   git push
   ```

5. **What happens to users:**
   - Service worker detects version change
   - Downloads new files in background
   - Shows notification: "New version available!"
   - User clicks → Gets new tool immediately

### Version Numbering Guide:
- **Major update** (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0): Complete redesign
- **Minor update** (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0): New tool added
- **Patch update** (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1): Bug fix, small change

## 📊 Cache Strategy Explained

Your PWA uses **"Stale While Revalidate"** strategy:

```
User opens app
  ↓
Serve from cache (fast!) ✅
  ↓
Check network for updates (background)
  ↓
If updated → Cache new version
  ↓
User gets fresh content next visit
```

**Benefits:**
- Always fast (cache first)
- Always fresh (updates in background)
- Works offline

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Update Behavior

Edit `sw-register.js`:

```javascript
const PWA_CONFIG = {
  showInstallPrompt: true,           // Show install prompt?
  installPromptDelay: 30000,         // Wait 30 seconds before showing
  showUpdateNotification: true,      // Show update notification?
  autoUpdateDelay: 5000,             // Auto-update after 5 seconds
  enableOfflineIndicator: true       // Show offline banner?
};
```

### Change Theme Color

Edit `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "theme_color": "#dc2626",  // Red (current)
  "background_color": "#ffffff"  // White (current)
}
```

### Change App Name

Edit `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Your New Name",
  "short_name": "Short Name"
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Registering?

**Solution 1:** Check HTTPS
- PWA only works on HTTPS or localhost
- Vercel provides HTTPS automatically ✅

**Solution 2:** Clear cache
```
Chrome → DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear site data
```

**Solution 3:** Check console for errors
```
F12 → Console tab → Look for [SW] or [PWA] messages
```

### Update Not Showing?

**Check version changed:**
```javascript
// sw.js - Did you increment this?
const CACHE_VERSION = 'pera-nai-vai-v1.0.0';
```

**Force update:**
```
DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Update
```

### Icons Not Showing?

**Check file paths:**
- Icons must be in root folder OR public folder
- manifest.json looks for `/icon-192x192.png`
- Verify file exists at that path

**Test manifest:**
```
DevTools → Application → Manifest → Check icon URLs
```

### App Won't Install?

**Requirements:**
- ✅ HTTPS enabled
- ✅ manifest.json linked
- ✅ Service worker registered
- ✅ At least one icon (192x192 or 512x512)
- ✅ start_url defined

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Service Worker Scope:
- Registered at root: `/`
- Can control all pages
- This is intentional and correct

### Cache Security:
- Only caches same-origin files
- External resources not cached
- No sensitive data cached

### Updates:
- Service worker checks for updates every visit
- Critical security updates deploy immediately
- Users get updates within 60 seconds

---

## 📈 Monitoring PWA Performance

### Check Install Rate:

Use Google Analytics (if you add it):
```javascript
// Track installs
window.addEventListener('appinstalled', () => {
  gtag('event', 'pwa_install');
});
```

### Check Update Rate:

Add to `sw-register.js`:
```javascript
// After successful update
console.log('[Analytics] User updated to version:', newVersion);
```

### Monitor Offline Usage:

Service worker logs all offline requests:
```
DevTools → Console → Filter: [SW]
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Level Up Your PWA:

1. **Add Push Notifications** (future)
   - Notify users about new tools
   - Already structured in service worker

2. **Add Background Sync** (future)
   - Sync data when online
   - Already structured in service worker

3. **Add App Shortcuts**
   - Already added in manifest!
   - Long-press app icon → Quick access to tools

4. **Improve Offline Page**
