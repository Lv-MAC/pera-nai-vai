   ```

3. **Click "Generate All Icons" button**
   - 8 icon files will download to your Downloads folder

### Step 3: Deploy (1 minute)

2. **Bump version in `sw.js`:**
   ```javascript
   // Line 3 in sw.js
   const CACHE_VERSION = 'pera-nai-vai-v1.0.0';

   // Change to:
   const CACHE_VERSION = 'pera-nai-vai-v1.1.0'; // ← Increment this
   ```

3. **If you added new files, list them in `sw.js`:**
   ```javascript
   // Around line 20 in sw.js
   const TOOL_PAGES = [
     '/jpeg-compressor.html',
     '/qr-generator.html',
     // ... other tools
     '/your-new-tool.html'  // ← Add your new tool here
   ];
   ```

4. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new tool + bump PWA version"
   git push
   ```

5. **What happens to users:**

**That's it!** Updates happen automatically. No app store approval needed.

## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Questions:

**Q: Do I need to update anything when deploying normally?**
A: No! Just `git push` as usual. Only bump version in `sw.js` when you want users to see update notification.

**Q: Will PWA slow down my site?**
A: No! It makes it faster. First visit is same, all future visits are instant (loads from cache).

**Q: Can users still use the website normally?**
A: Yes! PWA is optional. Users can still browse normally without installing.

**Q: Does this work on iPhone?**
A: Yes, but install prompt doesn't show automatically. Users manually "Add to Home Screen" from Safari.

**Q: How much data does it use?**
A: First visit downloads everything (~500KB). After that, uses almost no data (everything cached).
